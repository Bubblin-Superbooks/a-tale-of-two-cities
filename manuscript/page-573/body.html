At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”</p><p>“And do you really go to-night?”</p><p>“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.”</p><p>“And do you take no one with you?”</p><p>“All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.”</p></div> </div>
