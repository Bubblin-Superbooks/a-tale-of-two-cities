Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:</p><p>“What is it, brother? What's it about?”</p><p>“<em>I</em> don't know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”</p><p>He asked another man. “Who is it?”</p><p>“<em>I</em> don't know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi—ies!”</p><p>At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly.</p></div> </div>
